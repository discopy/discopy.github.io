## What?

DisCoPy is a Python toolkit for computing with string diagrams. 
It is free software hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/discopy/discopy).
To learn more, we suggest to start with [the documentation](https://docs.discopy.org).

## Why?

[Applied category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_category_theory) is information plumbing. It's boring... but *plumbers save more lives than doctors*.

Once [string diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram) become as ubiquitous as matrices, they will need their own fundamental package: *DisCoPy*.

## How?

DisCoPy began as an implementation of:

- [DisCoCat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisCoCat) (distributional compositional categorical) models,
- and [QNLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_natural_language_processing) (quantum natural language processing).

This application has now been packaged into its own library, [lambeq](https://cqcl.github.io/lambeq/).
