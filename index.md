# What we believe

[Category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) is to the 21st century what linear algebra is to the 20th century.
[String diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram) are meant to become as fundamental and ubiquitous as matrices.

# What we do

We develop DisCoPy, the Python toolkit for computing with string diagrams.
The library is [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), the sources are open and hosted at:
