## Why?

[Applied category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_category_theory) is meant to become the linear algebra of the 21st century.
When [string diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram) will be as ubiquitous as matrices, they will need their own fundamental package: **DisCoPy**.

## How?

DisCoPy is [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software),
its source code is open and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/oxford-quantum-group/discopy).
To learn more, we suggest to start with [the documentation](https://discopy.readthedocs.io).
