# What we believe

[Category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) is meant to become the linear algebra of the 21st century.

[String diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram) will become as ubiquitous as matrices, they need their own fundamental package.


# What is DisCoPy?

DisCoPy is the Python toolkit for computing with string diagrams.
It is to category theory what [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is to linear algebra.

DisCoPy is [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software),
its source code is open and hosted at:

- [https://github.com/oxford-quantum-group/discopy]
